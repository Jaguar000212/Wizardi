> A multi utility Discord bot coded in Python

My motive is to provide a full functionality discord bot for all your requirements and vanish the need to have multiple bots with same features just to have another one.  
The bot is based on `Disnake`, the popular fork of `discord.py`

The bot is being hosted as `Wizardi` and is available on [Invite]().
